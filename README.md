# Tildagon Name Badge

> I've only tested this on a simulator so far, so not sure if it works on real hardware yet!

A 'Hello my name is' sticker style name badge app for the [EMF](https://emfcamp.org) 2024 [Tildagon Badge](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/).

## Configuration

The name shown on the badge is asked on first startup then saved into a file called `name` on the root of the device. If you later need to change your name, simply delete or edit the `name` file :)

There are some hard-coded colour values part of the class which can be edited by hand.
